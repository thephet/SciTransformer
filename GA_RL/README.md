This folder contains the main scripts used to either do the Genetic Algorithm  or the Reinforcement Learning.

* GA.py is your classic old school genetic algorithm. Nothing fancy here. It uses evaluate.py from utils to simulate the experiments and then calculate their fitness functions.
* GA_XOR.py subclasses GA.py and mainly rewrites the fitness function to optimize for a XOR gate.

* Controller.py is the Reinforcement Learning Controller. It mostly uses transformer.py and changes the head to be the controller, and then it has a new custom loss function.
* TestController.py is very similar to the generate sequences functions from evaluate.py (in utils)

* dataoscillations2video.py and do2v_xor.py are very similar to the one you can see in utils, but here I just rewrote a bit of the stuff to work better with the GA and RL and generate the videos. These scripts are just to create plots.

* heatmap.py given a pickle file as generated by TestController (this will return a tuple that you need to pickle) or GA_XOR.py, it will generate a heatmap as the ones plotted in the manuscript.
* RL_plots.py just generates plots as the ones in the RL section of the paper.
